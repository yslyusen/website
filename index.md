## Yusen Liu

I am an undergraduate at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics.

I am currently working on providing operating system support on near-memory accelerators advised by Professor [Michael Swift](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~swift/).

My CV can be accessed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nKqCgzHfNdsE1prmNGG-FuljY3IMjgP7/view?usp=sharing). Nothing distinguished, but I firmly believe hardwork will pay off someday.

### Research Interest

I am interested in systems research with an emphasis on Operating Systems and Hardware-software Co-design.

## Research Details
What I have done so far is following Professor Swift's advice and learning every detail of Linux device drivers implementation. This is hard for those who have never stepped into the kernel but only called several syscalls in their C programs, with limited knowledge in computer architecture. For instance, take a look at the implementation of the most widely used function [```malloc()```](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/include/linux/decompress/mm.h#L34). Hence, I spent lots of time going through the book Linux Device Drivers, but I do believe I have only grabbed the overview of the device drivers.

When I was going through the example codes, I found the [code](https://github.com/martinezjavier/ldd3) that supports the latest kernel version. I made my own [repository](https://github.com/yslys/ldd) and added detailed comments in it so that it will help me recall each step of the code; furthermore, for those who are interested in Linux Device Drivers, such repository could as well be one of the references.

Now, I have started reading some real implementations of device drivers, and will keep updating this page when something new happens.




## People I am grateful for @UW-Madison
[Michael Swift](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~swift/) - (12/24/2020) the one who leads me into the world of systems and Linux device drivers.

[Shauna Crowther](https://esl.wisc.edu/staff/crowther-shuana/) - (Spring 2021) the best ESL 118 professor that guides me on academic writing throughout the semester.
