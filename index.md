## Yusen Liu

I am an undergraduate at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics.

I am currently working on providing operating system support on near-memory accelerators advised by Professor [Michael Swift](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~swift/).




### People I am grateful for
Professor Michael Swift - the one who leads me into the world of systems and Linux device drivers.

Professor Shauna Crowther - the best ESL 118 professor that guides me throughout the semester in Spring 2021.
